# User Experience
## Owner goals
My main purpose of creating this website was to get my project done and as the first ever website that I built on my own from scratch,  I chose to create a resume website to be used as the foundation of a future website for myself. This has been an amazing experience and the website will improve in the near future and will be used as a professional platform for my career.
## User goals
The user may enter the website through my social media links or if I leave it on my business cards as well as search engines in case they search for me on the web or for a developer. They would be able to make contact for job opportunities or freelance projects. They could also reach out to me on my social media through the links on the website or the conatct form.

# Features and Structure of the Website
The website consists of 3 pages including : Home, resume, contact me
## Home
At the top of the page, we have a navigation bar which lets the user navigate through the different pages of the website. 
This page consists of a banner containing a photo of me as well as my name and current status on the left hand side of the photo. There is a dashed "hr" element and a short bio below the banner as well. The photo loads with a zoom animation.
At the bottom, we have a footer in which we have icons that are links to my LinkedIn and Instagram accounts as well as an icon for my resume. The user can download a PDF file containing my resume by clicking on that icon.

## Resume
At the top we have the same navigation bar as the homepage.
Then there is the banner containing another photo of me as well as my name, email and job title on the right hand side of the photo. It is worth mentioning that the structure of the page is slightly different on devices less than 600px wide, given that the photo was a square and I put the name and email and job title below the photo on those devices. The photo loads with an apearing animation using opacity of the photo.
Then we have the CV presented through paragraphs and lists indicating my education and experience as well as my skills. At the bottom of the resume there is a link to a pdf file containing my resume.
Then we have the footer. However, on this page footer is fixed so that while the user is scrolling through my resume can immdediately open the links to my social media accounts.

At the top we have the same navigation bar.
Then there is a form containing inputs for name, subject, email and message as well as the send button and a reset button. The user can contact the owner though this form.
On the right, there is the email address of the owner as well as links to social media through icons and a link to the pdf file containing the resume.

# User Interface

## colors

I used minimaslistic colors with a good contrast. On all pages except for the resume the background color is white. On the other hand on the resume page the background color is a shade of light grey #D3D3D3. I made that decision as the profile photo of my resume had a white background and I wanted my photo to blend in with the banner and have some contrast between the banner and my resume. Then, I used a charcoal color mostly for the color of my fonts #3a3a3a. On the footer and nav bar the background color is black and the fonts are white.

## Fonts
I used Roboto as the main font and Oswald for headings and sans-serif as backup.

## Images
I used a couple of photos of myself for the homepage and for the resume page.

## Icons
I used 5 icons in total, three in footer and two in Contact me. The icons were free png's downloaded from the web and are mentioned in the credits section.

# Testing

## Responsiveness
I used Chrome developer tools all the way through the project this helped me with making my website responsive and figuring out styling issues so that I could fix them.

## Compatibility
I loaded the website hundreds of times on my macbook pro 14 inch as well as 27 inch 4K monitor to check for issues. On my iPhone 14 pro max. Additionally, I asked a friend to check on his smaller iphone 11 and macbook air. 

## W3C html validator
I used this tool to validate my codes. Except for a couple of unused paragraphs left from laying out the initial structure of the website issues and missing the word content= before my keywords in the meta element, and an alt attribute for an icon in the footer, there was no other issues.
